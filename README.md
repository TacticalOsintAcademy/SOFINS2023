# SOFINS 2023

6th SOFINS edition at the Camp de Souge in Gironde, France (33). Organized by the Cercle de l’Arbalète.

Unique in Europe, this biannual event is the meeting point of high-tech industries with Special Forces and Special Units. During 3 days, small and medium-sized companies and large industrial groups will meet under the umbrella of the Cercle de l’Arbalète in order to offer unique solutions tailored to the needs of special operations.

The Souge camp will be transformed into a place of meetings & technical demonstrations: dynamic tests of equipment in conditions which will allow innovative manufacturers to demonstrate the added value of their equipment for the operators of the future. A new feature this year is an immersion in the SFs’ operating methods and tools.
